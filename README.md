# hangman-game-in-python

This is a mini-project with Python without the need for any package to run.

Here I have coded a hangman  game in python using classes and inheritance.

Hangman Class is designed so that developers are free to use this class.

Fruit and color classes inherit from the Hangman class.

You can use the words in the fruit and color class.

This code is written in such a way that the user can choose the number of letters of the word.
